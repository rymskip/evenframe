error: Evenframe derive macro only supports structs with named fields.

       Example of a valid struct:

       struct TupleStruct {
           id: String,
           name: String,
       }
 --> tests/ui/fail/struct_tuple_fields.rs:5:12
  |
5 | pub struct TupleStruct(String, i32);
  |            ^^^^^^^^^^^
